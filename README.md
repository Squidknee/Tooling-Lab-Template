## Self-Reflection:
To get this lab started was a nightmare, having to jump through all the hoops just to be able to get everything set up to what it should have been before the lab started. I was able to do the first two parts after that, but we never learned how to write tests ourselves. I tried my best to follow the cypress tutorial as well but this entire lab lacks so much direction that it is hard to know what is supposed to go where. I personally believe I was able to do a good job with the resources I was provided, and I know one lab grade gets dropped so I may as well just take the loss on this one. 

### How long it took me to finish this?
like 4 hours before I gave up
